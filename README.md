# Best-in-Show
Source code for Best in Show talk, SCALE13x Dev Ops Day, Fri 2/20/2015 4:30 p.m.

I've done my best to make sure that all quotes are straight quotes.  If any script fails to execute properly, check if the quote marks it uses are straight.

Also included are one or more files that my 30 min talk lacked the time to cover.

Note: the resources for this talk are at my blog: slevy1.wordpress.com - http://wp.me/pNIWX-10j (starting 2/20/2015)
